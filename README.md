Create a testing DSL for espresso tests

Setup a CI server

Use a device farm

Mock espresso E2E tests at http level rather than repository level (bit like contract testing)

Create espresso Activity tests which mock view model states (test only UI rendering correctly), maybe use for screenshot testing

Better unit test coverage especially for view models

automate with google play alpha beta test track
